# ASCall

## Description

A TypeScript utility library for standardizing operation results and handler
lifecycles.

---

## Goal

This project is in early development. The goal is to provide a **strongly-typed
framework** for:

- Handling asynchronous operations and events in a consistent way.
- Representing operation results as `ResponseSuccess` or `ResponseFailure`.
- Using builders to construct responses safely and predictably.
- Creating extensible handler classes for complex workflows.

---

## To Do

- Add `ASCall` class to orchestrate asynchronous actions with `Handlers` and
  return standardized `Response`.
- Add unit tests for `Response` and builders.
- Refine lifecycle and initialization rules for builders.
- Write example workflows combining `Handlers` and `Responses`.
- Document breaking changes and API evolution.
